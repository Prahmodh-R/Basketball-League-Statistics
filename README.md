# Basketball-League-Statistics
A GUI tool that allows users and support staff to access the data and statistics of all the players in a BasketBall Tournament. Built with Python(including Numpy and matplotlib libraries) with MySQL Connectivity, this project facilitates the work of all the stakeholders involved in a basketball tournament. It helps the coaches of the various teams to assess players performances and strategize for the games ahead. They can analyse the opposition’s strengths and weaknesses and the program provides them with simple and indicative ideas along with a suggested squad for every game. Line charts and bar graphs have been included to provide a clear cut visualization of the game in general. The inclusion of an updated points table, end season awards(of teams, players and coaches),win predictors add to the projects’ ability to generate reports on various aspects of the game.
